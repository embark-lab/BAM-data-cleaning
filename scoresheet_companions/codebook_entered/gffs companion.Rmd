## 1. Background

This companion file is for the Goldfarb Fear of Fat Scale (GFFS) which was introduced in 1985 as a diagnostic tool to measure one's fear of fat as it can be an indicator for the development of an eating disorder (Goldfarb et al., 1985). When used as a screening tool for both clinical and non-clinical groups, GFFS has strong test-retest reliability and psychometric properties (Pryzbyla-Basista et al., 2022). In addition, the test also has shown high validity for both populations with and without eating disorders (Goldfarb, 2010). GFFS uses a 4-point scale with 1 being equal to very untrue and 4 being equal to very true, and a 1-factor solution has been supported for scoring.

## 2. Scoresheet

In order to clean the data:

- Select raw variables being used

- Rename variables to include numbering for order of questions in the scale

- Recode labels scale to begin at 0 instead of 1 with very untrue being equal to 0 and very true being equal to 3

- Sum the total scores and rename this summary as `gffs_sum`

##
## 3. Key Variables
 
`gffs_1_fear_fat` (assesses if biggest fear is becoming fat)
`gffs_2_fear_little_gain` (assesses fear of minor weight gain)
`gffs_3_overweight_risk` (assesses fear of becoming overweight)
`gffs_4_cannot_live` (assesses opinions of how overweight people can live)
`gffs_5_fat_worst` (assesses if becoming fat is worst outcome)
`gffs_6_concentrate` (assesses if concentration on weight control prevents becoming fat)
`gffs_7_painful_thought` (assesses if thoughts of weight gain being fearful can be controlled)
`gffs_8_energy_control_weight` (assesses energy that goes towards weight control)
`gffs_9_eat_lose_control` (assesses fear of losing control when eating)
`gffs_10_stay_hungry` (assesses if staying hungry is meant to prevent becoming fat)
`gffs_sum_complete` (sum of answers for the previous 10 variables)
`gffs_sum_25` (weighted sum of gffs for all individuals with < 25% missing items)
